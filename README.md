Project Title

CIT-U Peer-to-Peer Skills Exchange Platform

Objectives:

The project aims to develop a functional platform that enables students to exchange 
skills through secure access, user profiles, and interactive features while ensuring
active participation through onboarding and meaningful exchanges during testing. 
By utilizing available tools, resources, and volunteer participants, the system will 
remain feasible and realistic within scope. The goal is to deliver a reliable, 
user-friendly solution that fosters collaboration, knowledge sharing, and personal
 growth among students, with development and validation completed within the 
project timeline and strong user satisfaction achieved upon rollout.

Scope:

The project scope covers the development of a responsive web application accessible 
via desktop and mobile browsers, featuring secure student login, user profile creation, 
real-time skill listings and requests, peer-to-peer exchanges (voluntary, barter, or low-cost),
 communication tools, search and skill-matching, and a basic feedback and rating system.
 Out of scope are third-party payment gateway integration, large-scale deployment beyond 
CIT-U, and advanced AI-driven recommendation systems.
